# Web Scraping Framework

this framework is a Python-based web scraping tool designed to crawl websites efficiently while implementing sophisticated techniques to evade website security mechanisms and prevent blocking. Whether you require data extraction for research, analysis, or any other purpose, WebScraper streamlines the web scraping process, making it both effective and user-friendly.


## Features

It offers several essential features to enhance your web scraping experience:

- **Request Throttling:** Avoid overwhelming target websites by intelligently throttling your requests, ensuring a respectful and non-disruptive scraping process.

- **Random Time Intervals:** Implement randomized time intervals between requests to mimic human browsing behavior, reducing the likelihood of triggering website security measures.

- **User-Agent Rotation:** Automatically switch User-Agents for each request to make your scraping activities appear more like legitimate user interactions.

- **IP Rotation via Proxy Server:** Enable IP rotation through a proxy server to further disguise your scraping activities, making it challenging for websites to detect and block your access.

These features collectively enhance the reliability and stealthiness of your web scraping tasks, enabling you to gather data with minimal disruption and increased success rates.

Replace `URL` with the URL of the website you want to scrape.

> If you wish to start the crawling process from a supplied address and clear any previously scraped data, you can use the following command:

WebScraper generates output in the form of JSON files, which are stored in the `/data/` directory. Each JSON file contains the raw HTML content of a webpage in the following format:

   ```json
   {
     "url": "URL of the webpage",
     "content": "Raw HTML content of the webpage associated with the URL"
   }
   ```
